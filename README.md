<h3> What do I write?</h3> 
Oh, I understand, I'm a good programmer, you can see my projects and use them if you like. I've tried to write two languages so you often understand what it's about. And I do these projects for myself and I don't have a specific goal of working on these projects.
<h3>Why are you programming?</h3> 
Personal interest
